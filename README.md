## Notes
due to a shared drive not allowing for api access to the google sheet, i will periodically make a copy and save it on my personal drive. All of the data processed will be using my own copy. I will try to save every 2 hours or so and replace the sheet id with a new one. 


## Future Considerations: 
  * Need to make the HTML all the same size so the png's don't look weird when we crop them
  * data safety
  * testing - generate data 
  * ensure 3+ part names are compatible
